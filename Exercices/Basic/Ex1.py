# Exercise 1: Here you have a list called 'ABC', composed of numbers and strings,
# the goal is to have (programmatically) a list 'result' that only has the strings of ABC.
#

ABC = [1, 'a', 2334123.23, 'dewfv', '23', 3323]

result = []
# Fill code here.

print(result)
# result should be : ['a', 'dewfv', '23']
